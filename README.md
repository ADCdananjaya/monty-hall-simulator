# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

This project simulates the classic Monty Hall problem using an Angular frontend and a .NET Core backend. The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where players face a choice between three doors: one has a car behind it, and the others have goats. After choosing a door, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat. Players are then given the option to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door. The crux of the problem lies in whether switching doors increases the chances of winning the car.

## Features

- Real-time feedback on the outcome of the simulation.
- Detailed explanation of the problem and its solution.
